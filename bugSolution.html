The solution is to carefully review class names and remove any extra spaces, and double-check for typos using your code editor's spell check or by referencing the Tailwind CSS documentation to ensure the class name is exactly correct. Here is the corrected code:

```html
<div class="bg-blue-500 text-white">
  This div will now have the correct styling
</div>
<div class="text-white">
  Corrected typo in class name
</div>
```
