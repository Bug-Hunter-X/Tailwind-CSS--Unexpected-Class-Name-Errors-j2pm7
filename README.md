# Tailwind CSS: Unexpected Class Name Errors

This repository demonstrates two uncommon issues that can occur when using Tailwind CSS.  These issues don't always produce clear error messages, making them harder to debug.

**Issue 1: Extra Spaces in Class Names**

Including an extra space within a class name will render the class unusable.

**Issue 2: Minor Typos in Class Names**

Slight typos in class names will also prevent the class from working correctly.

The `bug.html` file contains the code demonstrating the bugs, and `bugSolution.html` shows the fixes.
